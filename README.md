# My Profile Website

## Introduction
This Web Project follows the template whose Image Has been shown in the Images under the refImages folder. The Idea was provided in the Odin's Project Course, As I was navigating through the Course. In short, it is one of the project included in Odin's Project Course.

## Development Process
We will construct the Website in 4 Sections Plus the Footer. We will go Each Section by Section. It is a single page website. I will start with the placeholders (For Name, titles and Everything) as stated in the Image. Then we replace the placeholders with the actual businesses.


I will update this README File as needed.
